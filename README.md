- Open the plugin in figma, select the layers we want, copy the command, and run in project.
- Two options
  - Smart Export.
    - There will be prompt that allow us to specify how we want them to export the design. (To HTML/CSS or other frameworks)
    - Example: builder-first-example
  - Classic Export
    - Easy Mode: For simple designs; doesn't require much setup.
    - Precise Mode: Requires perfect Auto Layout. If your Auto Layout is perfect, this gives you pixel-perfect results that match your structure 1:1.
    - Example: builder-second-example
